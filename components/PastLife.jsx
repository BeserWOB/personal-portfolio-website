                <p>I spent 28 years living in Novi Sad, Serbia, where I established my family and built a life for myself. It was my home, and I knew every street, every caf√©, and every park like the back of my hand.</p>

                <p>However, in 2019, my family and I made the decision to leave everything behind and start a new chapter in Wolfsburg, Germany. It was a tough decision to leave behind the place I had called home for so long, but I knew it was the right choice for the future of my family.</p>

                <p>Leaving everything was not easy, but I was excited to explore and meet new people. As we settled into our new home in Wolfsburg, we began to discover everything the city had to offer, learned the language, and made connections with our new neighbors.</p>
